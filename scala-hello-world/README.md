# Scala Maven Project

## Description
Hello World Starter application for building a maven scala project. Used for instruction during 1904Labs Hours with Experts course.

## Instructions:
1. Open the pom.xml in Intellij
2. Select “Open as Project”
3. Make sure you can run the Scala code. Head to the App.scala file, and there should be a green arrow next to the main method. Click the green arrow, and click run.
    - Note, if you don't see this green arrow or running the App doesn't work. Check to make sure you have the Scala plugin installed, as well as the Scala SDK ( 2.12.10 ) added to the project.
4. Now we can run the tests. In the `com.farrellw.hwe.exercises` package, there are four classes and four corresponding test classes. Start with `MiscellaneousTests.scala`, and click the green arrow next to the test suite and click run. You should see 11 tests fail.
5. Solve the functions in `Miscellaneous.scala`, until the tests in MiscellaneousTests.scala pass.
6. As you have time, continue to solve the other test cases in sequence:
- Word Count
- Roman Numeral
- Next Biggest Number
