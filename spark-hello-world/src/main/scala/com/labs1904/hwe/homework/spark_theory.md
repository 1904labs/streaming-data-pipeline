# Overview

Similar to the work you did for Kafka, this is your crash course into Spark through different questions. In this homework, your
challenge is to write answers that make sense to you, and most importantly, **in your own words!**
Two of the best skills you can get from this class are to find answers to your questions using any means possible, and to
reword confusing descriptions in a way that makes sense to you. 

### Tips
* You don't need to write novels, just write enough that you feel like you've fully answered the question
* Use the helpful resources that we post next to the questions as a starting point, but carve your own path by searching on Google, YouTube, books in a library, etc to get answers!
* We're here if you need us. Reach out anytime if you want to ask deeper questions about a topic 
* This file is a markdown file. We don't expect you to do any fancy markdown, but you're welcome to format however you like
* Spark By Examples is a great resources to start with - [Spark By Examples](https://sparkbyexamples.com/)

### Your Challenge
1. Create a new branch for your answers 
2. Complete all of the questions below by writing your answers under each question
3. Commit your changes and push to your forked repository
