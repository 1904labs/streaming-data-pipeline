# spark-hello-world
An example Spark application written in Scala and setup using Maven.


## Homework Instructions
Your work on the homework is to use any resources you can find to answer all the questions asked in spark_theory.md and HelloWorldBatchApp.scala.
Here is what you need to complete: 

* Start by completing your answers to the questions in spark-hello-world/src/main/com.labs1904.hwe/homework/spark_theory.md. There are further instructions on spark_theory.md that give tips and helpful resources to guide you in the right direction. You are welcome to use any resources you can find (youtube, articles, books, your teachers, etc)
* Complete the TODOs in HelloWorldBatchApp.scala in the same directory as spark_theory.md
* **Important Note** - Do not commit the bootstrap servers to github. You are welcome to commit and push your work to github, but make sure to change them back to "change-me" before committing and pushing to github. 
## Studio Instructions

# The Lab

## Challenge 1: Run the Batch App

Open up `HelloWorldBatchApp.scala` from `src/main/scala/com/labs1904/hwe`. Right click on HelloWorldBatchApp and choose 
"Run MyApp" to run the Spark app locally. If all goes well, you should see output similar to the following in the 
console:

```
2022-02-01 21:12:18 INFO  HelloWorldBatchApp$:12 - HelloWorldBatchApp starting...
root
 |-- _c0: string (nullable = true)

+-------------------------------------------------+
|_c0                                              |
+-------------------------------------------------+
|Space.                                           |
|The final frontier.                              |
|These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.|
|It's continuing mission:                         |
|to explore strange new worlds                    |
|to seek out new life and new civilizations       |
|to boldly go where no one has gone before!       |
+-------------------------------------------------+
```

If you don't, check out the Known Issues section below.

## Challenge 2: Implement Word Count in the Batch app

Open up `WordCountBatchApp.scala`. 

Make the app run.

Implement the method named `splitSentenceIntoWords`.

Use the method you implemented in your spark program.

## Challenge 3: Run the HelloWorldStreamingApp Structured Streaming App

Open up `HelloWorldStreamingApp.scala`. Run it just like you did the Batch App above.

How often is data printed out?
Where is the data coming from?
Why do we run locally?

## Challenge 4: Implement Word Count in the WordCountStreamingApp Structured Streaming app

The WordCountStreamingApp structured streaming app requires a Kafka cluster. The data on the topic is a list of
sentences. 

Open up `WordCountStreamingApp.scala`.

Configure the app to read from the Kafka cluster and write the output to the console.

Refactor the app to do word count and print the top 10 counts to the console.

# Known Issues

## An illegal reflective access operation has occurred

If you get the following warning, you are using the wrong JDK. You must use JDK version 8 (sometimes called 1.8).

```
WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred
WARNING: Illegal reflective access by org.apache.spark.unsafe.Platform (file:/Users/Kit/.m2/repository/org/apache/spark/spark-unsafe_2.12/3.0.1/spark-unsafe_2.12-3.0.1.jar) to constructor java.nio.DirectByteBuffer(long,int)
WARNING: Please consider reporting this to the maintainers of org.apache.spark.unsafe.Platform
WARNING: Use --illegal-access=warn to enable warnings of further illegal reflective access operations
WARNING: All illegal access operations will be denied in a future release
```

To change this in Intellij, go to File -> Project Structure. Make sure that the right JDK is selected, for example you
may use `correcto-1.8` downloaded through Intellij.

## Scary warnings

You may get some scary warnings. You can ignore the following

```
2022-02-01 20:40:52 WARN  Utils:69 - Your hostname, 1904labss-MacBook-Pro.local resolves to a loopback address: 127.0.0.1; using 192.168.1.163 instead (on interface en0)
2022-02-01 20:40:52 WARN  Utils:69 - Set SPARK_LOCAL_IP if you need to bind to another address
```

this too

```
2022-02-01 20:40:52 WARN  NativeCodeLoader:62 - Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where applicable
```

TODO: maybe fix here? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19943766/hadoop-unable-to-load-native-hadoop-library-for-your-platform-warning

## MacOS can't assign requested address

Problems running locally?

```
spark.conf.set("spark.driver.host", "localhost")
```

## Connecting to a single node cluster

To write data to a single ndoe cluster, you'll need the following config:
```
spark.conf.set("spark.hadoop.dfs.client.use.datanode.hostname", "true")
spark.conf.set("spark.hadoop.fs.defaultFS", "hdfs://quickstart.cloudera:8020")
```

## WinUtils

You may experience the following error on Windows:
```
2018-01-23 17:00:21 ERROR Shell:396 - Failed to locate the winutils binary in the hadoop binary path

```

This error is mostly harmless although annoying. To fix it, you'll need to download Hadoop binaries for windows. Luckily, there is a repo with these already.

```
git clone https://github.com/steveloughran/winutils
```

Then, in your IntelliJ run configuration, add an environment variable named `HADOOP_HOME` with the value as the path to wherever you cloned winutils, for example: `C:\Users\USERNAME\Code\winutils\hadoop-2.7.1`

# Other Stuff

For a more complicated project, you may run into conflicts between dependencies. In that case, switch to use the maven-shade-plugin.

    <!-- Alternative to maven-assembly-plugin -->
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>

        <configuration>
            <createDependencyReducedPom>false</createDependencyReducedPom>
            <keepDependenciesWithProvidedScope>false</keepDependenciesWithProvidedScope>

For Cloudera's distribution of Hadoop, add the following to your pom.xml
    
    <!-- Cloudera specific dependencies -->
