# Overview

Kafka has many moving pieces, but also has a ton of helpful resources to learn available online. In this homework, your
challenge is to write answers that make sense to you, and most importantly, **in your own words!**
Two of the best skills you can get from this class are to find answers to your questions using any means possible, and to
reword confusing descriptions in a way that makes sense to you. 

### Tips
* You don't need to write novels, just write enough that you feel like you've fully answered the question
* Use the helpful resources that we post next to the questions as a starting point, but carve your own path by searching on Google, YouTube, books in a library, etc to get answers!
* We're here if you need us. Reach out anytime if you want to ask deeper questions about a topic 
* This file is a markdown file. We don't expect you to do any fancy markdown, but you're welcome to format however you like

### Your Challenge
1. Create a new branch for your answers 
2. Complete all of the questions below by writing your answers under each question
3. Commit your changes and push to your forked repository
